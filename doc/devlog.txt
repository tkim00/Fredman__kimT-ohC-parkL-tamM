Worked on game setup pages:
0. Player first chooses difficulty, ranging from easy to hard. This determines
the amount of money the player starts with.
1. Player chooses their character. For now, they will only be able to
make their name.
2. Player is redirected to the shop, where they can purchase and sell supplies.
There are error messages if they do not have the sufficient amount to complete the
action.
Afterwards, the player starts the game. The basics of the setup pages are complete.
We will focus on the game itself, and if we have more time we will update them.

Main backbone of game completed.
- Progresses through one day at a time.
- After certain days, player will reach planet and have a different interaction.
Our next goals are:
- factor in player settings (how much food they want to use, how fast they go)
- add character stats
- implement encounters
