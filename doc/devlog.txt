Fixed shop and added crew status. Game is fully functional, but very one dimensional.
We need to add random encounters, which should be easy. We also need to link up the
game to HTML, which may prove problematic.

Created the homescreen and will be waiting for a briefing on game code by Mnafred to get
the display correct.

Connected setup to game. Rudimentary game completed.

- Random encounters
- Crew status

Added pages for settings and inventory. User can check their inventory and see
how much of each item they have. They can change the speed they travel and the
amount of food they consume per day.

Main backbone of game completed.
- Progresses through one day at a time.
- After certain days, player will reach planet and have a different interaction.
Our next goals are:
- factor in player settings (how much food they want to use, how fast they go)
- add character stats
- implement encounters

Worked on game setup pages:
0. Player first chooses difficulty, ranging from easy to hard. This determines
the amount of money the player starts with.
1. Player chooses their character. For now, they will only be able to
make their name.
2. Player is redirected to the shop, where they can purchase and sell supplies.
There are error messages if they do not have the sufficient amount to complete the
action.
Afterwards, the player starts the game. The basics of the setup pages are complete.
We will focus on the game itself, and if we have more time we will update them.
