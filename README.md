#### Description
Taking inspiration primarily from Oregon Trail, this website is a text-based strategy game with a goal at the end. The game will be set in space, and you as the player can pick your starting equipment, difficulty, and crew members before you set off to your journey. Once the initial preparation is done, the game will be tracked in days as the player will encounter numerous situations.
